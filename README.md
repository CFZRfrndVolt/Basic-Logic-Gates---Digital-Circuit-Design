# Basic-Logic-Gates---Digital-Circuit-Design
This repository contains VHDL implementations of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). It includes designs and simulations using Quartus II and ModelSim. The project covers basic digital circuit design and FPGA testing, providing a hands-on introduction to digital electronics.
