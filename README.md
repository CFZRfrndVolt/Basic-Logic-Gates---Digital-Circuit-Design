Key Features:

•	VHDL Design: Each logic gate is implemented using VHDL, a hardware description language that provides an abstraction for designing digital systems.
•	Simulation: The designs are simulated using ModelSim for functional verification to ensure that the logic gates work correctly.
•	FPGA Implementation: After simulation, the projects are implemented on FPGA boards to test the circuits in real-world conditions.

Projects Include:

Basic Logic Gates: Implementation of the basic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) using VHDL.
Truth Tables and Boolean Expressions: Each logic gate is defined by a truth table and corresponding Boolean expressions, ensuring an understanding of its logical behavior.
Functional Simulations: Projects include tests for the truth tables and functional simulations to verify proper behavior before hardware implementation.
FPGA Verification: After simulation, the logic gates are programmed onto an FPGA to ensure they work as expected in physical hardware.

Tools and Software:

•	VHDL: For describing the behavior of digital circuits.
•	Quartus II: For synthesizing and implementing digital designs.
•	ModelSim: For simulating the VHDL code to verify logic gate functionality.
•	FPGA: For hardware testing of logic gate implementations.

This repository provides practical experience in the creation and testing of basic logic gates, which are foundational elements for any digital system design. Whether you're learning about digital electronics or need to test simple circuits, this repository will help you understand the fundamental concepts and tools involved in the process.
